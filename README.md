# Hytale Server Utils - TPA Plugin
This plugin adds a simple /tpa and /tpaccept command to the game, to allow for easily managing teleport requests with players.
This is meant to be a server environment compatibility mod, so all it does is add the command to allow for hyprid server environments play nicely with other plugins. An example case would be if there were multiple permissions plugins or essentials type plugins that add tpa, or an essentials like plugin that you REALLY like that does not have tpa, and you want to just add the single command to the server. That is when you would use this plugin. This plugin works GREAT as a standalone and it has a simple add and forget type of installation. I will add configurations to this later to allow for more granular control over how this would be intended to be used.
